The MVP was built using Replit’s vibe coding approach and leverages a React (PWA) frontend, TailwindCSS for styling, and Firebase for authentication, database, and notifications. Due to technical limitations in Replit (no React Native or MongoDB support), adjustments were made to deliver a web-first app that functions seamlessly on mobile browsers.
